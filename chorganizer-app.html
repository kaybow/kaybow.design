        <h3>RESEARCH AND TARGET AUDIENCE</h3>
        <p>After interviewing students living with roommates, and identifying their needs and frustrations, a problem statement was created: “User needs a way to communicate with roommates to share the load of household chores. Interestingly, user rarely interacts with roommate(s) and is frustrated with the lack of communication that leads to a disorganized household.”</p>

      <div class="unit xs-1 s-1 m-1 l-1-2 gutter">
        <h3>DEFINE AND IDEATE</h3>
        <p>Chorganizer is an organizational application for aiding roommates in sharing household chores and responsibilities and is targeted directly toward college-age roommates living together.<br><br>Requiring group participation and interactivity, the app focuses solely on chore completion to keep usability simple and straightforward. Unlike most chore apps, Chorganizer's points reward system is included in the app and not as an add-on feature. As a bonus, Chorganizer will be available for use across all platforms and can be synced to various devices the user(s) may have.</p>
