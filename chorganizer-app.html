        <h3>RESEARCH AND TARGET AUDIENCE</h3>
          <p>After interviewing college-aged students living with roommates, it was found that many users are frustrated by the lack of communication and initiative in sharing communal household chores. It was found that usually one or two roommates take care of the majority of the chores while others are less willing to help out.<br><br>After identifying the user’s needs and frustrations, a <b>problem statement</b> was created: “User needs a way to communicate with roommates to share the load of household chores. Interestingly, user rarely interacts with roommate(s) and is frustrated with the lack of communication that leads to a disorganized household.”</p>

        <h3>DEFINE AND IDEATE</h3>
          <p><b>App Definition Statement:</b> Chorganizer is an organizational application for aiding roommates in sharing household chores and responsibilities and is targeted directly toward college-age roommates living together.<br><br>Requiring group participation and interactivity, the app focuses solely on chore completion to keep usability simple and straightforward. Unlike most chore apps, Chorganizer's points reward system is included in the app and not as an add-on feature. As a bonus, Chorganizer will be available for use across all platforms and can be synced to various devices the user(s) may have.</p>

        <h3>CONCEPTS</h3>
        <p>Initial inspirations and influences were found in earthy, tactile textures—weathered old wood grain, nests and hay bales. I envisioned the antique farm equipment and century old farmhouses that represented the strong family ties of tradition and farming history.<br><br>During the sketching and concept-development stages, distressed and vintage typefaces were explored for the word mark. Logo sketches featured the Beking’s product; eggs, as well as nests, chickens and quaint farm scenes. Attention was paid to ensure the elements represented a rustic, traditional, home-grown roots vibe that would best suit the brand.</p>

        <h3>FINAL DESIGN</h3>
        <p>To represent the generations-old family farm theme, the typewriter-style typeface has a weathered, distressed appearance. An egg with the letter "B", for "Beking's" is centered within a textured nest, clearly representing the family's primary product; farm-fresh eggs.</p>
