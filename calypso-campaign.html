        <h3>CHALLENGE</h3>
        <p>The primary challenge of this campaign was to speak to the broad age range of people who typically purchase passes or tickets to Calypso Water Park.<br><br>The secondary challenge was to echo a single theme across various digital and print mediums.</p>

        <h3>RESEARCH</h3>
        <p>Through my research, I discovered that Calypso’s main target audience is families of an age range of 7-45 years of age. Visitors to the waterpark are often parents with young children who respond well to advertisements that utilize a bright colour palette and fun themes. Calypso’s secondary target audience are groups of pre-teens and teenagers aged 12-19 years of age.</p>

        <h3>CONCEPT AND STRATEGY</h3>
        <p>The tone of sarcastic humour paired with a bright summer colour palette was used to communicate to Calypso’s target audience with a broad age range of approximately 7-45.<br><br> Characters of various ages were developed and portrayed attempting to cool off in various humorous ways—a middle-aged man sitting in a kiddie pool, a young girl with a melting ice-cream cone pressed to her forehead and a teenage boy holding a hand-held mini fan to the side of his face. The illustrated characters are captioned with a sarcastic “REALLY?”, asking the audience, is this really how you want to stay cool in the summer heat?</p>

        <h3>FINAL DESIGN</h3>
        <p>To represent the generations-old family farm theme, the typewriter-style typeface has a weathered, distressed appearance. An egg with the letter "B", for "Beking's" is centered within a textured nest, clearly representing the family's primary product; farm-fresh eggs.</p>
