        <h3>PROJECT OVERVIEW</h3>
        <p><b>Cycle Secure</b> is an IoT bicycle locking and security mobile application paired with a GPS location device that attaches to the bike itself. The Cycle Secure device is fitted with both a motion and vibration sensor that notifies the owner when their lock is being tampered with or if their bike is on the move.</p>

        <h3>OPPORTUNITY</h3>
        <p>With environmental concerns on the rise, more and more people are opting to use a bicycle as their main mode of transportation. Unfortunately, as many as half of all active cyclists have had their bike stolen at some point in their lifetime, and few are ever recovered. A combination security and tracking system would be a valuable asset to any cyclist. </p>

        <h3>RESEARCH</h3>
        <p>Research was conducted to thoroughly understand the demographics and psychographics of Beking’s target audience, as well as the family’s core values. Market competition of other small Ontario farms was also considered and analyzed to begin to conceptualize the Beking’s brand.<br><br>The resulting tone: “Beking’s Poulty Farm is humble, fresh, health-conscious, eco-friendly, convenient and cheerful.”</p>

        <h3>CONCEPTS</h3>
        <p>Initial inspirations and influences were found in earthy, tactile textures—weathered old wood grain, nests and hay bales. I envisioned the antique farm equipment and century old farmhouses that represented the strong family ties of tradition and farming history.<br><br>During the sketching and concept-development stages, distressed and vintage typefaces were explored for the word mark. Logo sketches featured the Beking’s product; eggs, as well as nests, chickens and quaint farm scenes. Attention was paid to ensure the elements represented a rustic, traditional, home-grown roots vibe that would best suit the brand.</p>

        <h3>FINAL DESIGN</h3>
        <p>To represent the generations-old family farm theme, the typewriter-style typeface has a weathered, distressed appearance. An egg with the letter "B", for "Beking's" is centered within a textured nest, clearly representing the family's primary product; farm-fresh eggs.</p>
