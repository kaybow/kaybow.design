        <h3>WHAT IS AN ISOMETRIC ILLUSTRATION?</h3>
        <p>Isometric illustrations are visual representations of three-dimensions in a 2D world. Rather than having lines lead to vanishing points, lines run parallel to one another. While the illustrations lack in perspective, they still project an illusion of depth by using colour tints, shades, and the cast shadows of various object within the scene.</p>

      <div class="unit xs-1 s-1 m-1 l-1-2 gutter">
        <h3>CHALLENGE</h3>
        <p>Because of the lack of perspective (where objects further away from us visually appear smaller), it was initially a challenge to create depth to the scene. With the help of some strategically placed highlights, shadows, gradients and textures, the illustration was able to appear as if it existed physically in a three-dimensional space.</p>

        <h3>CONCEPTS</h3>
         <p>As isometric illustrations often portray fun and whimsical themes, I chose demonstrate the process of building cat furniture featuring the builderâ€™s themselves; tiny cats. I was inspired by scenes of construction sites, especially during lunch break, and the spirit of cats reputation for being playful, distracted and lazy.</p>
