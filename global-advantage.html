        <h3>PROJECT OVERVIEW</h3>
        <p><b>Ecosystem Maps</b> are visual representations of complex data that show relationships between various stakeholders (such as Federal Government, Provincial Governments, Global Markets, and Higher Education) within an ecosystem. Relationships of major stakeholders can be viewed as four key flows: money, people, information, and materials.<br><br>Examining these flows is important to understand underlying stories withian ecosystem,  identify strengths and weaknesses, and to view the overall effectiveness of the ecosystem. They can also be used to identify broader commercial systems the impact organizations, and reveal potential business and networking opportunities. As innovation map users often travel abroad to discuss business opportunities with potential investors and supporters, they require the ability to access and share important information remotely, quickly, and with ease. The <b>Innovation Ecosystem Mobile Application</b> is a translation of the map into a portable, mobile experience.</p>
        <p><b>CLIENT:</b> GLOBAL ADVANTAGE CONSULTING<br><b>PROJECT DURATION:</b> 4 MONTHS</p>

        <h3>GOALS AND OBJECTIVE</h3>
        <p>To build a high-fidelity prototype to demonstrate to investors the potential that this application could have as a full-fledged product. The application needs a “zoomed-in” perspective for viewing relationships between stakeholders, as well as being able to use as a portable reference guide. Quick, simple navigation is necessary for users to find and reference specific information quickly.<br><br>The full product will be accessible with a paid subscription where the option to purchase multiple ecosystem maps will be available to suit the users individual needs.</p>
