        <h3>PROJECT OVERVIEW</h3>
        <p><b>Cycle Secure</b> is an IoT bicycle locking and security mobile application paired with a GPS location device that attaches to the bike itself. The Cycle Secure device is fitted with both a motion and vibration sensor that notifies the owner when their lock is being tampered with or if their bike is on the move.</p>

        <h3>OPPORTUNITY</h3>
        <p>With environmental concerns on the rise, more and more people are opting to use a bicycle as their main mode of transportation. Unfortunately, as many as half of all active cyclists have had their bike stolen at some point in their lifetime, and few are ever recovered. A combination security and tracking system would be a valuable asset to any cyclist. </p>

        <h3>PERSONA RESEARCH</h3>
        <p>In researching target users for the Cycle Secure app, it was found that many users who commonly have their bikes stolen are avid cyclists in urban areas. The cyclist is either using their bike as their main mode of transportation to and from work or school, or for sporting purposes. These users typically lead active and busy lifestyles often with tight schedules, and are interested in saving time by eliminating the need to fumble with a bike lock’s combination code or key.</p>

        <h3>CONCEPTS</h3>
        <p>Initial inspirations and influences were found in earthy, tactile textures—weathered old wood grain, nests and hay bales. I envisioned the antique farm equipment and century old farmhouses that represented the strong family ties of tradition and farming history.<br><br>During the sketching and concept-development stages, distressed and vintage typefaces were explored for the word mark. Logo sketches featured the Beking’s product; eggs, as well as nests, chickens and quaint farm scenes. Attention was paid to ensure the elements represented a rustic, traditional, home-grown roots vibe that would best suit the brand.</p>

        <h3>FINAL DESIGN</h3>
        <p>The final design is a simple, easy-to-use app with a clean interface. There are only two top level views; <b>My Lock</b> and <b>GPS</b>. My Lock enables users to unlock their bike from within the app, as well as to add other locks into their network if desired. The GPS screen allows users to view the current location of their bike. <br><br>When the vibration sensor is triggered, the cyclist will receive a notification that their lock may be being tampered with. This notification will appear both in the app and on their phone’s home screen. The user has the option to view the details such as the duration of the vibration, or ignore. <br><br>If the motion sensor is triggered, the cyclist can both report the theft and view the GPS to see the bicycle’s current location.</p>
