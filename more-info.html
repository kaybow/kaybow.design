      <h4>PROJECT OVERVIEW</h4>
      <p>Beking’s Poultry Farm is a small, locally owned and operated egg farming business. Having been owned for three generations, the Beking’s family believes in traditional farming practices and takes pride in producing eggs from healthy, free-range chickens free of hormones, antibiotics and by-products.
      <br><br>The objective of this project was to redesign the business’ brand identity to better represent their services and communicate the family’s strong environmental values.</p>
      <p>CLIENT: ALGONQUIN COLLEGE OF APPLIED ARTS AND TECHNOLOGY
      <br>PROJECT DURATION: 4 WEEKS</p>

      <h4>CHALLENGE</h4>
      <p>Beking’s existing logo is very busy; with too many words, little imagery, and four different typefaces. With it’s bright yellow colouring, at first glance, it could be mistaken for a bargain advertisement.
      <br><br>Furthermore, the word “poultry” within the name creates confusion about whether they raise chickens for consuming, or eggs. Because the farm is solely an egg producer, it was important to incorporate an egg within the logo.
      <br><br>I was challenged to rebrand the business to appropriately represent the products the farm produces, as well as reflect the high quality standards the family both implements and values.</p>

      <h4>RESEARCH</h4>
      <p>Research was conducted to thoroughly understand the demographics and psychographics of Beking’s target audience, as well as the family’s core values. Market competition of other small Ontario farms was also considered and analyzed to begin to conceptualize the Beking’s brand.
      <br><br>The resulting tone: “Beking’s Poulty Farm is humble, fresh, health-conscious, eco-friendly, convenient and cheerful.”</p>

      <h4>CONCEPTS</h4>
      <p>Initial inspirations and influences were found in earthy, tactile textures—weathered old wood grain, nests and hay bales. I envisioned the antique farm equipment and century old farmhouses that represented the strong family ties of tradition and farming history.
        <br><br>During the sketching and concept-development stages, distressed and vintage typefaces were explored for the word mark. Logo sketches featured the Beking’s product; eggs, as well as nests, chickens and quaint farm scenes. Attention was paid to ensure the elements represented a rustic, traditional, home-grown roots vibe that would best suit the brand.</p>

    <h4>FINAL PRODUCT</h4>

  <div class="grid">
    <div class="unit xs-1 s-1 m-2-3 l-1-2">
      <p>To represent the generations-old family farm theme, the typewriter-style typeface has a weathered, distressed appearance. An egg with the letter "B", for "Beking's" is centered within a textured nest, clearly representing the family's primary product; farm-fresh eggs.</p>
