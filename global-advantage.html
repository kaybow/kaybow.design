        <h3>PROJECT OVERVIEW</h3>
        <p><b>Ecosystem Maps</b> are visual representations of complex data that show relationships between various stakeholders (such as Federal Government, Provincial Governments, Global Markets, and Higher Education) within an ecosystem. Relationships of major stakeholders can be viewed as four key flows: money, people, information, and materials.<br><br>Examining these flows is important to understand underlying stories withian ecosystem,  identify strengths and weaknesses, and to view the overall effectiveness of the ecosystem. They can also be used to identify broader commercial systems the impact organizations, and reveal potential business and networking opportunities. As innovation map users often travel abroad to discuss business opportunities with potential investors and supporters, they require the ability to access and share important information remotely, quickly, and with ease. The <b>Innovation Ecosystem Mobile Application</b> is a translation of the map into a portable, mobile experience.</p>

        <h3>GOALS AND OBJECTIVE</h3>
        <p>To build a high-fidelity prototype to demonstrate to investors the potential that this application could have as a full-fledged product. The application needs a “zoomed-in” perspective for viewing relationships between stakeholders, as well as being able to use as a portable reference guide. Quick, simple navigation is necessary for users to find and reference specific information quickly.<br><br>The full product will be accessible with a paid subscription where the option to purchase multiple ecosystem maps will be available to suit the users individual needs.</p>

        <h3>RESEARCH AND CHALLENGES</h3>
        <p>Research was conducted to thoroughly understand the demographics and psychographics of Beking’s target audience, as well as the family’s core values. Market competition of other small Ontario farms was also considered and analyzed to begin to conceptualize the Beking’s brand.<br><br>The resulting tone: “Beking’s Poulty Farm is humble, fresh, health-conscious, eco-friendly, convenient and cheerful.”</p>

        <h3>CONCEPTS</h3>
        <p>Initial inspirations and influences were found in earthy, tactile textures—weathered old wood grain, nests and hay bales. I envisioned the antique farm equipment and century old farmhouses that represented the strong family ties of tradition and farming history.<br><br>During the sketching and concept-development stages, distressed and vintage typefaces were explored for the word mark. Logo sketches featured the Beking’s product; eggs, as well as nests, chickens and quaint farm scenes. Attention was paid to ensure the elements represented a rustic, traditional, home-grown roots vibe that would best suit the brand.</p>
