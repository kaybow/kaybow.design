        <h3>CHALLENGE</h3>
        <p>It was important for the One + One brand be appealing to both brides and grooms, as well as being open and accepting of people from the LBGTQ community. For these reasons, it was important to choose a neutral design and colour palette with one accent colour that was not too feminine to appeal to a broader target audience.</p>

        <h3>RESEARCH</h3>
        <p>During my research, I found that many of the existing wedding planning websites utilized a lot of pinks and purples, typically appealing to the brides only. The websites showed overwhelming and confusing layouts, included background music, and offered confusing package purchasing options.<br><br>I believe brides-to-be are already overwhelmed with endless wedding decisions and tasks, and I felt it would be important to offer a website that was easy to navigate, simple, and straightforward.</p>

        <h3>CONCEPTS</h3>
        <p>With the findings from my market research, I challenged myself to stay away from anything too feminine in terms of colour, texture and font choices. My ultimate goal was to offer simplicity and elegance to this service; one where both a bride and groom-to-be would feel comfortable using. I used a calming accent teal blue, and left the elegant script writing to the headings only. Package options were organized into just three options, with the features of each clearly laid out. Sign-up was easy, with functionality of the form of utmost importance.</p>
