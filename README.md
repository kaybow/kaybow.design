My journey into the graphic design industry has been an evolutionary experience:
A childhood joy of colouring books turned into a love of paint and mixed media in my adolescence.
I studied fine arts but was intrigued by the wonderful, intricate world of graphic design.
Refusing to retire my beloved brushes and paints for a Macbook and Adobe software,
I aim to fuse my two passions together to create dynamic solutions to design problems.
