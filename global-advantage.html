        <h3>PROJECT OVERVIEW</h3>
        <p><b>Ecosystem Maps</b> are visual representations of complex data that show relationships between various stakeholders (such as Federal Government, Provincial Governments, Global Markets, and Higher Education) within an ecosystem. Relationships of major stakeholders can be viewed as four key flows: money, people, information, and materials.<br><br>Examining these flows is important to understand underlying stories withian ecosystem,  identify strengths and weaknesses, and to view the overall effectiveness of the ecosystem. They can also be used to identify broader commercial systems the impact organizations, and reveal potential business and networking opportunities. As innovation map users often travel abroad to discuss business opportunities with potential investors and supporters, they require the ability to access and share important information remotely, quickly, and with ease. The <b>Innovation Ecosystem Mobile Application</b> is a translation of the map into a portable, mobile experience.</p>

        <h3>GOALS AND OBJECTIVE</h3>
        <p>To build a high-fidelity prototype to demonstrate to investors the potential that this application could have as a full-fledged product. The application needs a “zoomed-in” perspective for viewing relationships between stakeholders, as well as being able to use as a portable reference guide. Quick, simple navigation is necessary for users to find and reference specific information quickly.<br><br>The full product will be accessible with a paid subscription where the option to purchase multiple ecosystem maps will be available to suit the users individual needs.</p>

        <h3>RESEARCH AND CHALLENGES</h3>
        <p>It was important to understand and empathize not only the app's very specific target audience of government officials familiar with innovation maps, but also relate the app's use to the scenarios in which it would used.<br><br>It was determined that the app will be used primarily by trade commissioners while traveling to discuss business potential within Canada with foreign clients. As it is difficult to bring the entirety of the information contained within a printed ecosystem map, there was an opportunity to translate this information digitally to be accessible from anywhere at anytime. However, translating that information found on the visual printed map created it's own set of challenges.<br><br>Before designing, it was important to consider a variety of ways we could view this information from a "zoomed-out" perspective. By way of organization, the team managed to categorize and layer this information to provide the user with the ability to choose which information they wanted to see.</p>
