        <h3>OPPORTUNITY</h3>
        <p>Frequent travellers such as business professionals frequently stay in hotels as they travel, and each hotel is different—the lighting and temperature settings, the method of gaining access to guest rooms and hotel amenities, and they ways in which to pay for additional services such as dining in the restaurant and amenities. The need for consistency is something to be desired for one who spends a lot of time travelling. A wearable paired with an application to control these things to the wearer’s desired preferences would be the ideal solution.</p>

        <h3>PERSONA RESEARCH</h3>

        <h3>PRIMARY USE CASE SCENARIO</h3>
        <p>The frequent business traveller leads a hectic lifestyle, travelling often and solo for business purposes, and working long hours. As a frequent guest to various hotels, the user is often frustrated with the wide range of temperatures and light settings in each different hotel room. Often the guest is checking in late, and wants to avoid spending too much time at the check-in desk; he or she is eager to unpack their things and get some much needed rest and relaxation.<p>
