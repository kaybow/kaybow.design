        <h3>DISCOVERY AND TARGET AUDIENCE RESEARCH</h3>
          <p>After interviewing college-aged students living with roommates, it was found that many users are frustrated by the lack of communication and initiative in sharing communal household chores. It was found that usually one or two roommates take care of the majority of the chores while others are less willing to help out.<br><br>After identifying the user’s needs and frustrations, a <b>problem statement</b> was created: “User needs a way to communicate with roommates to share the load of household chores. Interestingly, user rarely interacts with roommate(s) and is frustrated with the lack of communication that leads to a disorganized household.”</p>

        <h3>DEFINE AND IDEATE</h3>
          <p><b>App Definition Statement:</b> Chorganizer is an organizational application for aiding roommates in sharing household chores and responsibilities and is targeted directly toward college-age roommates living together.<br><br>Requiring group participation and interactivity, the app focuses solely on chore completion to keep usability simple and straightforward. Unlike most chore apps, Chorganizer's points reward system is included in the app and not as an add-on feature. As a bonus, Chorganizer will be available for use across all platforms and can be synced to various devices the user(s) may have.</p>

        <p>Using a realistic use-case scenario, a storyboard was created to illustrate how the app would be used in context—frustrated roommates discussing the fair distribution of chore responsibility.<br><br>Thorough market research on existing chore-organization apps was conducted to understand common features, as well as potential opportunities that may exist. User feedback of existing apps was collected to determine what worked well and what needed improvement.<br><br>It was determined that the app needed to be organized, motivating, customizable and fun to use. Users found it important to have their own user profile, and a running summary of their completed chores.</p>

        <h3>PROTOTYPING AND USABILITY TESTING</h3>
        <p>After creating a rough flowchart, paper prototypes were created and tested with peers to ensure the flow of the app worked well. Main problems in the app flow, such as redundant screens or broken flows were identified and documented. Potential solutions were researched and implemented in a digital wireframe prototype.<br><br>Using the <em>InVision</em> application, the wireframe prototype was mocked up and tested in a second round of usability testing. From here, final problems and solutions were recorded and implemented, for example:<br><br><b>Problem Identified in Task #1:</b>Add a new chore to the chore list.<br><br>When the users were asked to complete the task, a couple minor issues were found. First, users hesitated at the screen where they were to choose a <b>due date</b> and <b>points</b>; it seemed unclear where the information should be entered. Secondly, there was confusion about whether or not a button had been clicked on and users repeatedly tapped the same button.<br><br><b>Solution:</b> To solve the problem of users unsure about whether or not they had selected a button; the selected button will highlight in another colour. The points section will feature a slider with pre-determined point levels in increments of 5 (ex. 10, 15, 20, 25…). The <b>save</b> button will be moved to the top right of the IOS screen.</p>

        <h3>USER INTERFACE DESIGN</h3>
        <p>To represent a fun and engaging theme, bright, energizing colours were chosen. Flat design illustration and ample white space makes the task at hand seem light, fun and easily accomplished.</p>
